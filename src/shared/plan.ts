/**
 * Which plan an account is on, and what that entitles it to.

 * any of them: someone who paid got exactly what someone who did not got. This
 * is the whole vocabulary — the plan, the model tiers it unlocks, and the one
 * function that decides which model a call is allowed to use.
 *
 * **`free` is the answer to every question this module cannot answer.** Signed
 * out, a build with no Supabase project, a metadata field holding something
 * nobody anticipated, a read that threw — all of them land on `free`. The
 * failure mode of guessing high is that an unpaid account quietly spends on the
 * top model; the failure mode of guessing low is a paying user seeing an
 * upgrade prompt they can dismiss by signing in again. Only one of those is
 * recoverable, so nothing here ever fails open.
 *
 * A leaf: no relative value imports, so `npm test` can load it.

 *
 * **`user_metadata` is deliberately not consulted, and reading it as a
 * "fallback" was a working free-to-Pro escalation.** The account holder can
 * write it themselves with one request against Supabase's own API:
 *
 *     PUT /auth/v1/user   {"data": {"plan": "pro"}}
 *
 * The earlier version defended the fallback on the grounds that app_metadata
 * still won, so a user could not override a plan the server had set. True, and
 * beside the point: an account that has never been through the webhook has NO
 * app_metadata plan at all — that is every free account — so the fallback was
 * the only field consulted for precisely the people who had not paid.
 *
 * Anything unreadable, absent or unrecognised is `free`. Guessing high spends
 * the top model on an unpaid account; guessing low shows a paying user a
 * prompt they can clear by signing in again.
