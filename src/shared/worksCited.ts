/**
 * The works-cited list at the end of the writer's own document — where it is,
 * what is already in it, and what to write to add one more entry.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * "Add Citation (Inserted)" (Figma 298:130) says **ADDED TO WORKS CITED** and
 * offers **View Works Cited**. Both sentences assert the document HAS such a
 * list. It did not: the button toggled a grey block inside the card, so the
 * only works-cited list in the product was a picture of one. A confirmation
 * that confirms something which did not happen is worse than no confirmation,
 * because the writer stops checking.
 *
 * Where the section lives, and why
 * --------------------------------
 * **In the document body, as ordinary text.** Not a React region rendered
 * beside the editor, which was the easier build: a reference list that is not
 * in `body_html` is not in the essay the student hands in — it does not copy,
 * does not print, and is gone when the document is reopened anywhere else — so
 * the card would still be claiming something untrue, just less visibly. It is
 * also the only form `parseBibliography` (bibliography.ts) can see, and that is
 * the module the fabrication check reads a reference list with; a sidebar list
 * would be invisible to the half of this product whose job is reading one.
 *
 * The cost of that choice is that every edit to it goes through `execCommand`
 * against a contentEditable nothing may otherwise touch (see the note at the
 * top of `renderer/src/components/documentMarks.ts`). That is the shape this
 * module is built for: it decides everything against a plain string and hands
 * back **one** replacement span, so the DOM side is a single `insertText` over
 * a single Range — one undo step, exactly like the in-text marker beside it.
 *
 * A leaf module (the one import below is type-only and erases), so `npm test`
 * can load it. Ordering and dedupe are the two decisions here with a wrong
 * answer available, and both are silent when wrong.
