/**
 * When the editor may detect claims without anyone pressing anything.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Underlines needed a button. `runStructure` was the only relay-touching path
 * in the editor and its own docstring said "Never automatic ... `handleInput`
 * fires on every keystroke" — a correct worry, answered by making the writer
 * ask for the whole reading every time. Owner, 2026-08-21: *"How can we get the
 * underlines to appear immediately, kind of like Grammarly, instead of waiting
 * until we click the 'grade essay' button?"*
 *
 * ── Detection is not grading, and only one of them belongs on the button ───
 * `runStructure` makes TWO relay calls: `detect-claims`, which is what the
 * underlines are made of, and `grade-draft`, which is the essay score. Only the
 * first has anything to do with marks. So detection becomes automatic and
 * grading stays exactly where it is — behind "AI Insights", which is a button
 * that means "grade my essay" and should keep meaning that.
 *
 * ── The bounds are Screen Watch's, because it solved this already ──────────
 * Screen Watch has read other applications' text automatically for months under
 * three guards, and they are the same three here. The names differ only because
 * Screen Watch polls and the editor has real input events, so the "has it been
 * quiet?" part is a debounce timer rather than a comparison against a poll.
 *
 * Re-detecting UNCHANGED text is free — `ai/claimDetection.ts` caches on a hash
 * of the normalized input — so what these bound is the cost of text that has
 * genuinely moved on.
 *
 * A leaf with no imports, so `npm test` can load it.
 */

/**
 * How long the writer has to stop typing before detection runs.
 *
 * Shorter than Screen Watch's 4s STABLE_MS on purpose. That one is fighting the
 * gap between its 1200ms poll and the pause between words; here the input event
 * is exact, so the only thing being waited out is mid-sentence hesitation. 2.5s
 * is past a comma and well short of a reread.

 * Shortest draft worth a detection call.
