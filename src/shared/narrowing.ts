 *             scoring performance comparable to or sometimes exceeding the
 *             average human rater on academic English essay rubrics…
 *

 * match the evidence — and dropped the AP rubric and the vendor citation with
 * it. A student who accepts that is asserting something they never claimed,
 * about a different model, with the attribution removed.
 *

 * a narrowing; a name the original does not contain is a fact the student did
 * not assert. Hedges add words like "some" and "may", never entities.
