// on plain node, and services/auth/client reaches Electron for the userData
// path, which would put the Electron binary shim in the eval bundle.
//
// So it borrows the session the desktop app already wrote. Nothing new to
// configure and no second set of credentials to keep somewhere: sign in to
// Tracely once, and the eval authenticates as you. The refresh token in that
// file is exchanged for a fresh access token by supabase-js, exactly as the
// app does, so a stale file still works.
