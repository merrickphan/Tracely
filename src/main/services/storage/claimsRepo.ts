 * Re-analysing a document makes a NEW analysis with a NEW set of claim rows,

 * the second time you pressed AI Insights on the same essay, every claim came
 * back with `strength_score = null` — and the editor draws no underline at all
 * for a claim nothing has been searched for (see documentMarks.ts, which is
 * right to: an unsearched claim has no verdict to report). Every underline
 * vanished, on the most ordinary action there is: edit a bit, run it again.
 *
 * Found on Merrick's draft, which had been analysed six times: 48 claim rows,
 * one run of 8 scored, and the newest run — the one on screen — scored none.
 *
 * Matching is on EXACT text. A sentence the writer has since edited is a
 * different claim and must be searched again; only a sentence that survived the
 * edit untouched inherits, which is exactly when the old evidence still applies.
 * The evidence rows are copied too, not just the score: the editor reads its
 * article count from `claim_evidence` by claim id, and a score with no rows
 * beneath it is the same "nothing known" from the renderer's point of view.
