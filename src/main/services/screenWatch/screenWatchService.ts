 * the four free public APIs; critique does not, and that is the whole line.
 *
 * The known cost, which is real and should not be rediscovered as a bug:
 * `problemKindFor` reports "Weak reasoning" only when `critiqueVerdict` is set,
 * and critique now only ever runs from an explicit click on "Critique Argument"
 * (see `critiqueClaim`). So passive watching can report on citations and
 * evidence, but never on reasoning, until the user asks. Everything needed to
 * change that is still here — `synthesizeEvidenceItem`, `withEvidenceScores`
 * and the evidence map all remain — so putting it back behind an opt-in
 * Settings toggle is a small change, and is the shape it should return in.
 *
 * `git log` has the implementation.
