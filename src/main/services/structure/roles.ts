/**
 * Which paragraph carries the thesis — not necessarily the first one.
 *
 * The rule was purely positional: the thesis is in paragraph 1, or 2 behind a
 * title, and nowhere else. That is one essay shape, and a common and often
 * better one puts two or three paragraphs of setup first and states the claim
 * once the reader can see why it matters. Measured on a deliberately
 * well-structured essay whose thesis opened paragraph 5 ("Almost every tool
 * built for writers … has been built to remove friction, and almost none of
 * them distinguish between the friction that is the work and the friction that
 * is merely in the way"): thesis scored 0/20, and every paragraph before it was
 * 'unknown', so the reading was also "provisional".
 *
 * So the opening position is tried first and, failing that, the scan continues
 * to the HALFWAY point of the draft and takes the first paragraph whose last
 * sentence has the shape of a thesis.
 *
 * Two bounds keep this from swallowing body claims. It stops at the halfway
 * point, because a claim stated for the first time in the second half is a
 * body claim however thesis-shaped it reads. And it never considers the final
 * paragraph, where a thesis-shaped sentence is the conclusion restating it.
 *
 * Lateness is priced rather than ignored: `scoreDraft` already awards half
 * credit for a thesis found past position 1, so being generous here cannot
 * hand a delayed thesis the same marks as an up-front one.
