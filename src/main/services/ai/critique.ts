// Critique is the app's single most expensive call — it runs once per
// claim, on the reasoning model, while detection runs once per document on
// the cheap one. Eight claims means eight of these, so what goes into them
// is where the money is.
//
// Previously: the top 5 evidence items by rank, whatever they were. An eval
// run showed ~2 of 3 retrieved sources are off-topic, so most of that
// spend was paying the expensive model to read a paper about atrial
// fibrillation and conclude it doesn't support a claim about school start
// times. Dropping items that don't clear the relevance floor cuts input
// while *improving* the critique, because the model stops splitting its
// attention across noise — the one case where cheaper and better point the
// same way.
//
// The floor is only applied while at least MIN_KEPT items survive it: a
// claim whose retrieval failed entirely still needs a critique that says
// so, and "no supporting evidence was found" is a different (and less
// useful) message than "here are the two closest things we found".
// Relevant items FIRST, then the rest as padding — not "the filtered list, or
// else the raw list". The raw list is ordered by rank, so the old fallback
// (`relevant.length >= MIN ? relevant : evidence`) then took the first four by
// rank: a claim with exactly one relevant source sitting at rank 5 had that
// source dropped and four off-topic ones sent in its place. The one case the
// fallback exists for is the one case it broke.
//
// `slots` is what the cited source takes one of when the sentence named a work
// the lookup found — see shared/citedEvidence.ts. Passing it in rather than
// reading the constant directly is what keeps the cost of reading a citation at
// zero: the list does not grow, its last searched item is displaced.

  //
  // The id looked equivalent and was not. Screen Watch synthesizes its claims
  // in memory with a fresh randomUUID() on every detection (see
  // synthesizeClaim), so an id-keyed entry could never be hit there: editing a
  // paragraph and having the same sentence re-detected paid a fresh call on the
  // reasoning model — the most expensive call in the product — for input the
  // relay had already answered. The in-app path had a weaker version of the
  // same problem, since re-analyzing a document mints new claim rows too.
  //
  // strengthScore is in the key because it is in the request body. It usually
  // moves with the evidence set, but not always: the same sources rescored (ML
  // on vs off) is a different question with the same evidenceIds.
  // v7: the response gained `suggestedRevision` and `citationFix`. Every v6
  // entry was written by a relay that could not produce either, so reusing them
  // would silently withhold the new output from exactly the claims a user has
  // already looked at — the ones most likely to be looked at again.
  // v8: the request gained `referenceCheck`. It is IN the key rather than
  // merely bumping the version, because it can differ between two runs of the
  // same claim over the same evidence — Crossref is a live index and the
  // check can time out — and a critique reasoned over "no work by these authors
  // was found" must not be served for a request that says the opposite.
  // v9: the cited work now occupies slot 1 of the evidence list when a
  // reference resolved. It is IN the key rather than merely bumping the
  // version, for the same reason `referenceCheck` is: whether Crossref answered,
  // and whether OpenAlex had an abstract for what it returned, can differ
  // between two runs of an unchanged claim over an unchanged evidence set — and
  // a critique reasoned over the writer's own source must not be served for a
  // request that never saw it, nor the reverse.

  // by the writer, and the relay's Pass 2.5 became a stop rather than a
  // priority. Neither is visible in `evidenceIds` — the key is built from the
  // set of source ids, not from the rendered summary — so without this bump
  // every claim already critiqued kept returning its v9 answer, written by the
  // old prompt over the old flat list. The symptom was the exact behaviour that
  // change existed to remove: "7 of 10 other articles do not support this",
  // still being reported after the fix shipped.
  //
  // The lesson for the next change here: this key must be bumped whenever the
  // REQUEST BODY or the relay PROMPT changes, not only when the response shape
  // does. A cached critique is an answer to a question that is no longer being
  // asked.
