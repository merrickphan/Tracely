/**
 * Whether the period ending at `dotIndex` is a real sentence boundary.
 *
 * Three ways it is not, all of them found in a single meticulously cited
 * position paper that Screen Watch mangled:
 *
 *  - **Inside brackets.** `(Thomas R. Leinbach, 2026)` was split in two, which
 *    severs the citation from the sentence that carries it — so the half with
 *    the claim in it looked uncited, and the half with the source in it looked
 *    like a sentence fragment. This is the structural rule and it is the one
 *    that matters: a period inside an unclosed `(` is never a sentence end.
 *  - **An initial.** `Gregory P. Margarian`, and equally `U.S.`, `e.g.`,
 *    `i.e.` — in every case the period follows a lone letter. "88% of
 *    international students in the U.S. have become less politically involved"
 *    was cut in half mid-clause, and the relay was then asked to find claims
 *    in each half.
 *  - **A known abbreviation.** `Dr.`, `etc.`, `vol.`
 *
 * The cost of a wrong answer here is asymmetric, which is why the rules lean
 * toward NOT splitting: two sentences merged is one over-long claim, while one
 * sentence split is a truncated claim, a truncated search query, and a
 * citation that has vanished from the text it belongs to.
