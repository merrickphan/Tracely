/**
 * Tracer — the conversational half of the app, restored.
 *
 * It was removed when the Screen Watch widget was rebuilt on the Figma frames,
 * which have no Tracer in them. What survived was the two SQLite tables, the
 * `Tracer*` types, the `TRACER_*` channels, and a relay endpoint nobody took
 * down. Home's frame draws a "Chat with Tracer" launcher, so it is back — as a
 * panel inside the main window rather than a `BrowserWindow` of its own.
 *
 * Two things still separate this from every other AI call here:
 *
 *  1. **Nothing is cached.** The others are keyed by a hash of their input and
 *     served from `cacheRepo` on a repeat, which works because they are pure
 *     functions of that input. A chat turn depends on the whole conversation so
 *     far, and the same follow-up in two conversations should get two answers —
 *     a cache would be actively wrong here, not merely useless.
 *  2. **The prompt lives on the relay** (`lib/prompts.ts` there), same as the
 *     other two. This side only ever sends raw content.

 * (`execCommand`), so the input is a small, known dialect rather than the web.
