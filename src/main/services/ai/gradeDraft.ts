/**
 * One graded read of the whole draft, from the relay.
 *
 * This replaces a stack of local rules — ten prose detectors, a cohesion pass,
 * an embedding-based tangent check and most of a weakness generator. Owner,
 * 2026-08-19, after two days of false positives: *"if I just gave an essay to
 * ChatGPT and had it graded with a detailed prompt, it would give a pretty good
 * response on what to change."*
 *
 * The rules were covering the easy half of the rubric and producing most of the
 * noise. The half a rule genuinely cannot reach — does this evidence actually
 * support this claim, is this counterargument the strongest one available — was
 * already in a prompt.
 *
 * **The model judges; this side adds up.** Component sub-scores come back and
 * `scoreDraft` sums them, so an unchanged draft scores an unchanged number and
 * every point traces to a quoted sentence.
 *
 * Null on any failure, and null is a supported answer: the caller keeps the
 * local path. A graded read that degrades to the old behaviour beats one that
 * fails the whole analysis because a network call did.
