        They predate the Argument Score report and say the same things worse: a
        flat list below the prose, outside any paragraph, with Find Evidence and
        Critique Argument buttons duplicated per card. The report now shows each
        claim inside the paragraph it belongs to, which is the whole reason the
        paragraph detail exists. Two views of the same claims, one of them
        context-free, is what made the editor feel like it had two disagreeing
        opinions about the draft.
