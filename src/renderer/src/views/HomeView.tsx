/**
 * Home — rebuilt from the owner's mockup, 2026-08-18.
 *
 * What it replaces: a pixel-exact transcription of Figma's "Frame Main Page",
 * whose sixteen elements sat at literal design coordinates inside a fixed
 * 870x606 canvas. That is why Home was the one view in the app that could not
 * reflow, and why it had to keep its size and centre when the window became
 * freely resizable. This layout is ordinary flow and grid, so that exception is
 * gone with it — Home fills the window like everything else now.
 *
 * The old screen was also mostly illustration: a decorative popover, a dotted
 * flight path, a flying logo. This one is almost entirely real state — three
 * computed statistics, the actual recent documents, and the live Screen Watch
 * status — which is the substance of the change rather than the arrangement.
 */

/**
 * The four cards under "Resources". Content, not layout, so it sits up here.
 *
 * Each icon is one exported 40x40 SVG holding both the tinted disc and its
 * glyph, transcribed from the frame's own geometry — `Resource Card - *`
 * (525:141/147/153/159) read through `get_design_context`, which gives the
 * shapes to three decimals along with colours guessing had wrong: the pencil
 * is #f1650b rather than the brand orange, and the magnifier #7b44d4 rather
 * than a violet chosen to look about right.
 *
 * They were hand-drawn here for one build and did not match — wrong angle on
 * the pencil, wrong bar widths, a document at the wrong proportions. Redrawing
 * brand art from a screenshot is the mistake the mascot took two attempts to
 * stop making.
