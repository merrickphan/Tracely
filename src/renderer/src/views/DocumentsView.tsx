/**
 * Every essay Tracely has graded — Figma "DocumentsPage" (58:172).
 *
 * This replaced the Analyze view's landing, which was a text field and a
 * "Create Document" button. That screen asked for a name before it would let
 * anyone type, and it was the only way back to work you had already done: the
 * documents existed in SQLite but nothing listed them, so reopening a draft
 * meant it happening to be the most recent one. The frame answers both — the
 * grid IS the list, and "+ New document" starts an "Untitled document" and goes
 * straight to the editor, where the title is editable inline.
 *
 * Every measurement below is the frame's own, read with get_design_context
 * rather than taken off a screenshot: 181.5x200 cards on a 197.5px pitch, a
 * 122px thumbnail, a 34x22 chip at 6px radius, 13px titles and 11px dates.
 *
 * The grade is not computed here. `gradeFor` is the same function the Screen
 * Watch grade panel and the in-app modal use, so one draft cannot carry two
 * letters across three surfaces — the same rule as problemCopy.ts.
