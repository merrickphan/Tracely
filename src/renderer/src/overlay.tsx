// The overlay names Instrument Sans in its FONT_STACK but never loaded it, so
// every card drew in the system fallback (Segoe UI on Windows) while the main
// and floating windows — and the Figma designs all of this is drawn
// from — used Instrument Sans. Nothing about the layout was wrong; it simply
// was not the same typeface, which is most of why the overlay never quite
// looked like the mockups.
//
// Bundled by @fontsource, not fetched: overlay.html ships `default-src 'self'`
// with no font-src, so a Google Fonts URL would be blocked outright.
