/**
 * The school year every letter grade in this window is banded against.
 *
 * Context rather than a prop, because the six places that call `gradeFor` —
 * Home's average, the Documents cards, the report, the shared Essay Grade
 * panel — have nothing else to do with settings, and threading a number
 * through four view layers to reach them is how a setting ends up applied in
 * three places out of four.
 *
 * There is no settings-changed IPC event, so this re-reads on `setLevel`,
 * which `SettingsView` calls when the dropdown moves. That keeps the letters
 * on Home correct the moment the user comes back from Settings without adding
 * a channel for one number.
