/**
 * The confirmation sheet — Figma 212:65 (Frame 5).
 *
 * Its own component rather than a variant of ConfirmDialog, because the two
 * disagree about which button is loud and only one of them can be right per
 * dialog. ConfirmDialog gives the quiet treatment to Cancel and the heavy one
 * to Confirm. This frame does the opposite: Cancel is the orange gradient pill
 * and Confirm is grey.
 *
 * It was called SaveChangesDialog and it is not only about saving any more, so
 * the name went. What it IS about is the button arrangement, and that
 * arrangement turns out to be right for two different reasons:
 *
 *  - **Saving** is not destructive, so there is no reason to make the safe
 *    option the quiet one. The frame says so explicitly.
 *  - **Deleting** is destructive, and a loud Cancel is the SAFER arrangement,
 *    not a riskier one: the button that does nothing is the one under the
 *    cursor's natural path. An earlier note here warned that generalising this
 *    would put "a bright, inviting Cancel one prop away from the delete-account
 *    dialog". That worry had the sign backwards for a delete — a bright Cancel
 *    beside a quiet Confirm is exactly what a delete wants.
 *
 * ConfirmDialog stays where it is. Sign-out, clear-all-data and delete-account
 * carry a `requireText` gate this sheet has no concept of, and collapsing the
 * two would mean building it here for one caller.
 *
 * The "Do not show anymore" tick is OPTIONAL, and off for deletes. It persists
 * to `suppressSaveConfirm` for the save case, because a confirmation nobody can
 * disable is one people learn to click through without reading. A delete has no
 * undo and no trash behind it, so a switch that turns its only guard off for
 * good is not the same offer — see `showSuppress`.
