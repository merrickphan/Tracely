/**
 * The source's real site icon, falling back to the monogram tile.
 *
 * One component for both surfaces that draw a source row — the report's
 * evidence list and the editor's citation picker — for the same reason
 * problemCopy.ts is shared: two copies would be two products, and the version
 * that was edited second would drift on the box size, which is the thing that
 * has to match. The tile and the image occupy the SAME 28px / 8px-radius box
 * from the design, so a list mixing publishers that have an icon with ones that
 * do not still lines up on one grid rather than looking ragged.
 *
 * `className` rather than a fixed class, because the two surfaces style their
 * box differently (`argev-badge` in the report, `docmark-row-badge` in the
 * editor) and neither loads the other's stylesheet.
 *
 * The image is decoration over a row whose text is already correct: it renders
 * the monogram first and swaps when the icon arrives. There is deliberately no
 * loading state — a spinner where a publisher's mark will be makes a resolved
 * list look like it is still working.
