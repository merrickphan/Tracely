/**
 * A Settings section the Figma file draws but the product does not have.
 *
 * Notifications, Security, Integrations and Billing exist as frames
 * (33:93, 33:184, 33:366, 33:457) with fully populated sample values —
 * "Connected · jamie.d@example.com", a payment method, a plan. There is no
 * notification code, no OAuth provider and no payments behind any of it.
 *
 * These four were built once before, verbatim with those sample values, and
 * deleted again; the note at the top of SettingsView records why and says to
 * add the section back with the feature rather than before it. Merrick's call
 * on 2026-08-15 was to build them anyway, so the whole app matches the design —
 * but visibly disabled rather than pretending.
 *
 * So the layout, the labels and the field order are the design's, and the
 * VALUES are not. Printing "Connected · jamie.d@example.com" over an account
 * that does not exist is the one thing this component is here to avoid: a
 * screen that looks like it works, in an app whose entire premise is not
 * overstating what it knows.
