/**
 * What the document editor's "AI Insights" button opens.
 *
 * Figma "Real Tracely UI" (k7R5x1M9alKktaMLlZFSJn), four frames and the routing
 * between them — Merrick's spec, 2026-08-15:
 *
 *   353:129  Argument check ("SA Grid")   — WHAT AI INSIGHTS OPENS
 *   370:135  Essay Grade Widget           — the compact card, via Back
 *   404:129  Full Report — Expanded       — via "View Full Report"
 *   407:143  Paragraph Detail             — clicking any paragraph
 *   409:141  Find Evidence Result         — via "Find evidence" on a claim
 *
 * The landing view has moved three times and the history is the point: #46
 * opened the compact widget, #47 opened the full report on his instruction,
 * #48 went back to compact when he sent the frame, and on 2026-08-15 he asked
 * for "the OverlayMockup SAGrid widget". No frame carries that name — 353:129
 * is the only one in the file with a BREAKDOWN metrics grid (Support /
 * Relevance / Quality / Recency), and it was previously reachable ONLY via
 * "Open Argument Check", which matches "it's not doing that right now".
 *
 * Back from there lands on the Essay Grade widget rather than the full report,
 * because there is no screen you came from any more; the widget is the hub the
 * other views hang off.
 *
 * THE LABELS ARE THE DESIGN'S. This is the correction to the mistake that ran
 * through PRs #46-#50 and is worth writing down, because it was invisible from
 * inside every one of them.
 *
 * This file used to say the opposite: that the frames grade an essay and Tracely
 * measures how an argument is built, so it would keep the rubric's own words and
 * drop the design's — no "Essay Grade" title, no letter chip, no cohort line.
 * Defensible in isolation. What it meant in practice is that four PRs in a row
 * "fixed" which frame the buttons ROUTED to while the card those routes led to
 * never looked like the frame at all. Merrick kept saying "make it this frame"
 * and screenshotting 370:135; the routing kept getting fixed; the screen kept
 * not changing. Asked why, the honest answer was this paragraph.
 *
 * So: the title is "Essay Grade", the chip is a letter, the buttons read "View
 * Full Report" / "Back to Summary" / "Re-grade Essay". A letter grade is a
 * presentation of `outline.score`, which is a real number the rubric computes —
 * see GRADE_BANDS, whose bands are set so 82 reads B+ exactly as the frame does.
 *
 * ONE line in these frames is not a presentation of anything Tracely has:
 * "Above average for this assignment type" asserts a comparison against other
 * students' work, and there is no cohort and no assignment type to compare
 * against. That slot keeps the design's position, size and weight and says what
 * the score band means instead. Everything else on 370:135 and 404:129 is the
 * design's, verbatim.

 * rather than silently picking one out of several.
 *
 * Built from the frame, top to bottom: title + round close on one row over a
 * divider, the claim-type line with its dot, the quote, a divider, the score
 * block (eyebrow + band pill on the left, 26px number and /100 on the right,
 * a 6px track under both), BREAKDOWN, the four metrics as a 2x2 grid, the
 * sources line, a divider, the critique behind its own dot, and the two
 * buttons. It had none of that: an 18px title, the quote, one strength number
 * with no band and no bar, four full-width stacked bars, and no actions at all.
 *
 * TWO DEPARTURES, both because a frame is a picture of one state:
 *
 *   - No "← Essay Grade" in the header. The frame draws a single dismissal and
 *     nothing else on that row, so back went with the redraw. Reopening AI
 *     Insights lands on Essay Grade, which is one click from here.
 *   - The metric percentages are the four `scoreBreakdown` factors, not the
 *     design's numbers. `sourceCount` is the fifth and is not a percentage of
 *     anything, so it stays the sources line the frame already gives it.
