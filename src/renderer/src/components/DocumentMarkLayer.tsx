/**
 * "Suggest fix", answered in the popover instead of by navigating away.
 *
 * There is no Figma frame for this card — the design has the button and nothing
 * behind it (see fixFlowCopy.ts). It is built out of the pieces the popover
 * already has: the header dot in the mark's colour, `.docmark-body` prose, a
 * `.docmark-block` for proposed text exactly as the citation flow's preview
 * uses one, and the same two-button action row.
 *
 * What it shows is what the critique already produced and nothing else. No
 * relay call is made when it opens — the critique that raised the underline is
 * where every word here came from — which is what keeps this button honest on a
 * paid endpoint the user cannot watch being called.
 *
 * The one thing this surface does that the overlay does not is APPLY. This
 * editor owns its text: `replaceClaimText` types the narrowed sentence over the
 * old one through `execCommand`, so it lands on the browser's undo stack and
 * Ctrl+Z — or the card's own Undo, which is that same stack — takes it back
 * out. The overlay is reading someone else's window over UI Automation and
 * offers Copy instead. Same asymmetry as `Preview` in the citation flow, and
 * the same reason: each surface does what it can actually reach.
