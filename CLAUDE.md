# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Folio is a private, local-first Electron desktop app (React + TypeScript) that checks the *credibility* of user-written text: it detects factual claims, finds academic evidence (OpenAlex, Crossref, Semantic Scholar, PubMed), scores how well-supported each claim is, critiques weak arguments, and generates citations (APA/MLA/Chicago). All user data lives in a local SQLite (`sql.js`, WASM — no native module compilation needed) database under Electron's per-OS user-data dir. The only network calls are to academic search APIs and to the **Folio Relay**, a separate sibling project (`../Folio-relay`) that holds the real OpenAI key server-side — this app has no API-key field and never talks to OpenAI directly.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # electron-vite dev — boots main window + hidden floating-assistant window
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit for both main/preload (tsconfig.node.json) and renderer (tsconfig.web.json)
npm run build        # electron-vite build
npm run dist:win     # build + electron-builder --win -> installer in release/
npm run dist:mac     # build + electron-builder --mac (untested, config-only)
```

There is no test suite and no lint script currently configured. `npm run typecheck` is the only automated correctness check — run it after making changes.

### Relay setup for AI features

Claim detection and critique require a deployed Folio Relay. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `RELAY_URL` / `RELAY_TOKEN`. These are read once by `electron.vite.config.ts` and compiled directly into the main-process bundle via the `define` block (`__RELAY_URL__` / `__RELAY_TOKEN__`) — there's no runtime/user-facing way to change them; changing the relay means editing `.env` and rebuilding. Evidence search, scoring, citations, and the library all work with no relay configured.

### Windows packaging gotcha

`npm run dist:win` can fail the first time with `Cannot create symbolic link : A required privilege is not held by the client` while electron-builder extracts `winCodeSign` (irrelevant macOS `.dylib` symlinks, but the whole archive extraction is treated as failed). Fix: enable Settings → Privacy & Security → For developers → Developer Mode, then re-run.

## Architecture

Three Electron processes, strictly separated:

```
src/shared/         Types (types.ts) and IPC contract (ipc-contract.ts request/response shapes,
                     ipc-channels.ts channel name constants) — the only import shared across all
                     three processes. Import via the `@shared` alias.
src/main/           Node.js main process — all business logic lives here, nothing in the renderer.
src/preload/        contextBridge surface exposed as `window.folio` (typed `FolioApi`).
src/renderer/       React UI, two entry points (index.html main window, floating.html popup)
                     sharing components. Import via the `@renderer` alias.
```

### IPC pattern (adding a new feature follows this shape every time)

1. Define request/response types in `src/shared/ipc-contract.ts` and a channel constant in `src/shared/ipc-channels.ts`.
2. Add a handler in `src/main/ipc/<feature>Handlers.ts`: parse `raw` with a zod schema, call into a `services/` module, return the typed response. Register it in `src/main/ipc/index.ts`.
3. Expose it on the `api` object in `src/preload/index.ts` as a typed `ipcRenderer.invoke` wrapper.
4. Call it from the renderer via `window.folio.<namespace>.<method>(...)`.

Every handler validates its input with zod before touching a service — there is no untrusted input path into `services/`.

### `main/services/` — four independent domains

- **`ai/`** — `client.ts` (`callRelay`) is the only thing that ever makes a network call to the relay; `claimDetection.ts` and `critique.ts` build the request bodies. `costGuard.ts` centralizes hard limits (max input chars, max claims per analysis, max evidence items sent to critique) — check here before loosening any AI-related limit. AI is only ever invoked from an explicit user action (Analyze / Find Evidence / Critique), never on keystroke, and every call result is cached in SQLite (`cacheRepo.ts`) keyed by a hash of normalized input.
- **`search/`** — one client module per provider (`openalex.ts`, `crossref.ts`, `semanticScholar.ts`, `pubmed.ts`) each returning a `NormalizedSourceResult`. `aggregator.ts` fans out to all four in parallel via `safeSearch` (a provider failure returns `[]` rather than failing the whole search), dedupes by DOI (falling back to normalized title+year), and caps merged results. `scoring.ts` computes evidence strength as a **deterministic formula** (source count, venue quality, recency, relevance rank) — not an AI call. `rateLimiter.ts` throttles per-provider request rate.
- **`citations/`** — pure formatters (`formatters/{apa,mla,chicago}.ts`) from source metadata, no AI/network involved. `authorUtils.ts` truncates author lists to "et al." after 3 authors (a known MVP simplification, not the full style-guide rule).
- **`storage/`** — `db.ts` wraps `sql.js`: the whole database is an in-memory WASM DB that gets fully re-serialized and written to disk (`persist()`) after every `run()`. `schema.ts` holds the SQL DDL. One repo module per table (`analysesRepo`, `claimsRepo`, `claimEvidenceRepo`, `sourcesRepo`, `citationsRepo`, `libraryRepo`, `cacheRepo`, `settingsRepo`) — go through these rather than querying `db.ts` directly from elsewhere. `config.ts` handles the small `config.json` (currently just the optional Semantic Scholar key).

### Main-process entry (`src/main/index.ts`)

Single-instance lock (second launch just refocuses the main window). Boots in order: `initDb()` → create main window → create (hidden) floating window → tray → register IPC handlers → register global hotkey. The app stays alive in the system tray on `window-all-closed` specifically so the global hotkey keeps working with no window open; `before-quit` forces a final `persist()`.

### Floating window / hotkey flow

`hotkey.ts` registers a configurable global accelerator (default reflected in Settings) that grabs the current clipboard and shows the floating window (`windows/floatingWindow.ts`), which emits `FLOATING_CLIPBOARD_CAPTURED` to the floating renderer (`FloatingApp.tsx`) to auto-trigger analysis. Main window and floating window are separate `BrowserWindow`s with separate Vite entry points but share renderer components (`ClaimCard`, `EvidenceCard`, `CitationBlock`, etc.).

### Where user data lives at runtime

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Folio\folio.db` (SQLite: analyses, claims, evidence, citations, library, request cache) and `config.json` (Semantic Scholar key only — never the relay URL/token, which are compiled in).
- Settings → Privacy has two destructive ops: "Clear Analysis History" (`historyHandlers.ts` → `clearAnalysisHistory()`, keeps the library) vs. "Clear History + Library" (also wipes `sources`/`library_items`/`citations`).

## Known MVP simplifications (intentional, not bugs)

- Citation author formatting truncates to "et al." after 3 authors rather than implementing full APA/MLA/Chicago author-list rules.
- "Government datasets" as an evidence source is an unbuilt extension point.
- PubMed results have no abstract (would need a second NCBI `efetch` call per result; the other three providers already include abstracts).
