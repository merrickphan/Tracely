/**
 * One-command release: check, bump, build, publish.
 *
 * It integrates nothing. Fast-forwarding main to origin is the one exception,
 * and it is not integration — it moves to commits that are already the remote's
 * tip, and refuses the moment a real merge would be needed. Bringing branches
 * together happens when a feature is done, not when a release is due, so this
 * only publishes what is already on main.
 *
 * The steps are ordered so the irreversible one is last and gated. preflight
 * runs inside release:win and refuses to publish unless main is clean, in
 * sync, typechecked, every relay endpoint is live, and the version is above
 * the published one — so a bad state stops here rather than reaching users.

 * replaces it (see ROLLBACK.md). That made the release path the least-tested
 * code in the repo, which is the wrong way round.
 *
 * It is NOT side-effect free, and pretending otherwise would make it useless.
 * It really bumps the version, really opens the release PR and really merges it
 * to main — that sequence is the thing worth testing, and a version number is
 * cheap. What it does not do is build an installer or publish a release, so
 * nothing reaches a user.
 *
 * The cost is one skipped patch number: main ends up a version ahead of the
 * latest release, and the next real ship bumps past it. preflight is happy
 * either way — it requires the version to be strictly above the last published
 * release, which stays true.
