/**
 * Publish a preview build for review, without touching production.
 *
 * The counterpart to ship.mjs. That script cuts a real release for real users;
 * this one publishes a prerelease that can be installed and used without one.
 *
 * **From `main` only.** What would ship right now, if the merged work were
 * released. Everyone installs it once and leaves it installed, because it is
 * the only build that shows the integrated whole.
 *
 * Branch previews used to be allowed and are now refused — see the gate below.
 * Everything published here lands on the same preview channel, so an install
 * follows whichever build was published last, and a branch preview would take
 * that channel away from everyone until the next merge.
 *
 * You will rarely run this by hand. `.github/workflows/preview.yml` runs it on
 * a Windows runner on every push to main, which is how a merge reaches Tracely
 * Preview without anyone's laptop being involved. Running it locally is for
 * when CI is broken and you need a build anyway.
 *
 * Two mechanisms keep it away from production users:
 *
 *  - The version carries a `-preview` tag, so electron-builder writes
 *    `preview.yml` instead of `latest.yml`. Installed production builds poll
 *    `latest.yml` and never learn this exists. (A preview build's own
 *    app-update.yml says channel: preview, so reviewers keep getting previews.)
 *
 *    The channel is `preview` and deliberately NOT `beta`. Do not tidy it back.
 *    electron-updater treats `alpha` and `beta` as ranked channels of ONE app,
 *    so a beta client is offered any newer STABLE release: in
 *    GitHubProvider.getLatestVersion, a stable tag has a null prerelease
 *    component which makes `isCustomChannel` false, and a `beta` currentChannel
 *    makes `shouldFetchVersion` true — nothing in that condition excludes it.
 *    Right for one app with two channels; wrong here, because Preview is a
 *    separate application and "graduating to stable" hands a reviewer the
 *    production installer. That is not hypothetical: on 2026-08-14 a Preview on
 *    0.3.83-beta.2 downloaded Tracely-Setup-0.3.84.exe, which upgrades nothing
 *    about Preview, so it sat three builds stale while APPROVALS rows claimed
 *    the work was "in Preview". Any channel name outside ["alpha","beta"] takes
 *    the `isCustomChannel` path, which only ever matches its own releases. That
 *    match compares the channel name against the TAG's prerelease id, which is
 *    why the version below must be `-preview.N` and not `-beta.N`.
 *  - It ships under a different appId and productName, so it installs
 *    ALONGSIDE Tracely rather than upgrading over it, and keeps its own
 *    database under %APPDATA%\Tracely Preview. A broken preview cannot damage
 *    real work.
 *
 * Because it's a separate app, a preview never auto-updates into production —
 * that's the trade for being able to run both at once. Install real releases
 * the normal way.

// `check` is a required status check on main. A required check blocks *every*

// it yet. So CI pushing its own version-bump commit is a deadlock: the push is
// rejected pending a check that cannot start until the push succeeds. That is
// not a misconfiguration to work around; a branch that requires review-by-CI
// should not have a bot committing straight to it.
//
// So in CI the version comes from the run number instead of from the last one.
// GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER increases by one per run of this workflow and never repeats,
// which is all electron-updater needs — it compares versions and only ever moves
// forward. Nothing is committed and nothing is pushed; package.json on main stays
// at whatever the last real release left there, and the bump exists only inside
// the build. A later `npm version patch` in ship.mjs produces a clean 0.3.x that
// outranks every beta of it, exactly as before.
// Neither path commits any more. The local one used to, and that is now the
// same deadlock described above rather than a different case: main requires a
// pull request and enforces it on admins, so `git push origin main` from here
// is rejected outright — the manual fallback broke the moment the protection
// landed. A preview version is throwaway either way, so the fix is the one CI
// already uses: derive it, build with it, never write it down.
